# README

Monitors the battery percentage on Mac OS and notifies if the charger should be
connected or disconnected.

## Limitation

This program does not automatically stop the laptop from charging when the
battery reaches 80% charge. The goal of this program is to only notify you when
the battery drops to 20% or below and reaches 80% or above.

## Usage

Intended to be scheduled and run.
